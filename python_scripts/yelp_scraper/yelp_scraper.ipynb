Despite this, Beefsteak (named after the beefsteak tomato) manages to stand out. They boil their vegetables rather than dish them out raw, so if you\\'re into that or you want a change of pace from your standard salad, you won\\'t go wrong here. \\\\n\\\\nIngredients are also off the beaten path - examples include seaweed salad and poached egg. The offerings are fun and original. Most friends swear by the Frieda Kale (kale with black beans and spicy tomato sauce), while I\\'m partial to the Kimchi Wa or Eden with seaweed salad.\\\\n\\\\nMost importantly, the beefsteak crew knows how to have a good time. In almost four years in the city, I have yet to find a team as friendly and offbeat as this one.\",\"Rating\":\"5.0\"},{\"Published Date\":\"2018-12-27\",\"Comment\":\"I had never been to this location and in fact had never heard of it until I was looking at Jose Andreas website and saw this was a part of his cadre of restaurants and near my office. This place is a vegetarian\\'s paradise as there is only one meat item on the menu and all the dishes come vegetarian. Let me be clear, while I love veggies, I am not by any means a vegetarian. \\\\n\\\\nI got the beet sandwich, which was original, delicious and came with spicy sauce and on a fresh delicious bun.

Beefsteak specializes in vegetarian food, so the \\\\\"meat\\\\\" of the burger was actually plant-based protein to go along with avocado and tomato. The \\\\\"meat\\\\\" tasted similar to real meat, but was not as filling. The burger was good, but for $8, it was way too small. Also, it was kind of an awkwardly tall size to bite. I also got the lavender lemonade, which was decent. On the menu, it said the drink was only $1 with the burger, but it was actually $2.\\\\n\\\\nThe service speed is good, since it is Chipotle-style ordering. The place is decorated in a unique way, for example with plastic crates acting as lighting fixtures.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I was a bit deceived by the name of this place, and it reminded me of why I am not a vegetarian. The food is decent, but my portion was just too small and the prices are not very cheap. It is a good place to go if you are a vegetarian. If you are not, and especially if you are hungry, you might want to look elsewhere.\",\"Rating\":\"3.0\"},{\"Published Date\":\"2019-01-14\",\"Comment\":\"Was great to be walking by and accidentally stumble upon a vegan friendly restaurant!!

Do not order the rock hard corn nuts as a topping unless you want to lose your teeth. Overall my bowl was flavorless besides the kimchi which was the only thing enjoyable. Service leaves a lot to be desired. The cashier was using their phone for a seemingly dramatic personal phone call and holding up the line of people waiting to pay. The previous girl also forgot to put crunch toppings in the bowl after mine so the cashier cursed her out for not doing her job after the angry phone call was done.

Once you have spent $99, you get $9 back to spend.  I always, always get the same thing (when it\\'s good, it\\'s good).  The Eden bowl.  It is chocked full of tender, green veggies over a bed of quinoa and sauces. It is seriously delicious. In my opinion, it\\'s the most delicious item on their menu.

That being said, the range of choices was wide, and if you think about it, you can optimize yourself a pretty decent bowl. I got everything from potatoes and chickpeas to seaweed and corn nuts.
